        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p class="date">Last Updated: October 26, 2023</p>

        <p>Welcome to flow+ ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with your use of the flow+ application and services (collectively, the "Service").</p>
        <p>By using our Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Service.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>flow+ is designed to be a privacy-respecting service. We **do not** require user registration, and we **do not** collect any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, physical address, phone number, or precise location data.</p>
        <p>Our Service primarily acts as an aggregator and player for publicly available or third-party provided live television streams. We do not host these streams ourselves.</p>

        <h2>2. Information Collected Automatically (Non-Personal Information)</h2>
        <p>When you use our Service, we or our third-party service providers (like Shaka Player for video playback, and potentially analytics for app usage) may collect limited non-personal information automatically. This may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you interact with the Service, such as features used, channels accessed (as general usage patterns, not tied to an individual), session duration, and crash reports. This data is typically aggregated and anonymized.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> General information about your device, such as device type (e.g., mobile, desktop), operating system, browser type, and screen resolution. This helps us optimize the Service for different devices.</li>
            <li><strong>IP Address (Limited Use):</strong> Your IP address may be processed by the video player (e.g., Shaka Player) to establish a connection with the third-party stream providers. We do not store or log your full IP address for tracking purposes. Some stream providers themselves may log IP addresses as part of their service delivery.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This non-personal information is used for internal purposes such as improving the Service, diagnosing technical problems, and understanding user trends.</p>

        <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>Since we collect very limited information, its use is also limited:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Provide and Maintain the Service:</strong> To enable you to access and use the features of flow+.</li>
            <li><strong>To Improve the Service:</strong> To understand how users interact with our Service, identify areas for improvement, and enhance user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>To Monitor and Analyze Trends:</strong> To analyze usage patterns and ensure the stability and security of our Service.</li>
            <li><strong>To Fulfill Legal Obligations:</strong> If required by law or in response to valid legal requests by public authorities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services and Links</h2>
        <p>Our Service provides links to and embeds content (video streams) from third-party websites and services (e.g., Amagi.tv, various broadcasters). When you click on a third-party link or a channel is played, you will be directed to that third party's site or service. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit or service you use.</p>
        <p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. The playback of streams is handled by technologies like Shaka Player, which itself may interact with these third-party stream providers according to their respective protocols.</p>

        <h2>5. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p>flow+ itself does not currently use cookies for tracking users across sessions for advertising or extensive profiling. However, third-party components embedded within the app or the websites of the stream providers might use cookies or similar tracking technologies. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Shaka Player:</strong> May use local storage for player settings or buffering, but not for user tracking by flow+.</li>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Stream Providers:</strong> The actual stream providers may use cookies or other tracking mechanisms on their platforms. Please refer to their respective privacy policies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, some parts of third-party services might not function properly.</p>


        <h2>6. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>As we do not collect PII, the considerations for data storage primarily relate to any non-personal aggregated usage data. We take reasonable measures to protect any such information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error-free.</p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Service is not directed to individuals under the age of 13 (or a higher age threshold depending on the jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information (which should not be possible through our direct Service), please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from children without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information.</p>

        <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect PII, traditional data subject rights (like access, rectification, or erasure of personal data) may not be directly applicable in the same way. If you have any concerns about non-personal data or the practices of third-party stream providers accessed through our Service, please contact them directly or consult their privacy policies.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>

        <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us:</p>
