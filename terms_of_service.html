        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

        <p class="date">Last Updated: October 26, 2023</p>

        <p>Welcome to flow+ ("we," "us," or "our"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the flow+ application and related services (collectively, the "Service"). Please read these Terms carefully before using our Service.</p>
        <p>By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>flow+ provides users with a platform to access and play publicly available or third-party provided live television streams. The Service acts as an aggregator and player, and does not host, control, or own any of the content streamed. All streamed content is provided by third-party broadcasters or service providers (e.g., Amagi.tv, official broadcaster websites).</p>
        <p>The availability of specific channels or streams is subject to change without notice and depends on the third-party providers.</p>

        <h2>3. User Conduct</h2>
        <p>You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You agree not to use the Service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In any way that violates any applicable national or international law or regulation.</li>
            <li>To engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Service or the servers and networks connected to the Service.</li>
            <li>To attempt to gain unauthorized access to any portion of the Service, or any other systems or networks connected to the Service.</li>
            <li>To reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell, or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without express written permission from us.</li>
            <li>For any commercial purposes unless explicitly authorized.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
        <p>The Service itself, including its original features, design, user interface, and underlying technology (excluding third-party stream content and third-party player technologies like Shaka Player), is and will remain the exclusive property of flow+ and its licensors.</p>
        <p>All content, trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, and domain names associated with the third-party streams (e.g., channel logos, program content) are the property of their respective owners (broadcasters, content providers). flow+ does not claim any ownership rights over such third-party content. Your use of the Service does not grant you any right or license to use any of these third-party intellectual properties.</p>
        <p>You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of any third-party content accessed through the Service complies with all applicable laws and the terms of service of the respective content providers.</p>

        <h2>5. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. FLOW+ MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE OPERATION OF THE SERVICE, OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, OR MATERIALS INCLUDED THEREIN. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.</p>
        <p>TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, FLOW+ DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. FLOW+ DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE, ITS SERVERS, OR E-MAIL SENT FROM FLOW+ ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. FLOW+ DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE THIRD-PARTY STREAMS WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR AVAILABLE AT ALL TIMES.</p>
        <p>WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACCURACY, LEGALITY, OR APPROPRIATENESS OF ANY CONTENT PROVIDED BY THIRD-PARTY STREAMING SERVICES ACCESSED THROUGH FLOW+.</p>

        <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL FLOW+, NOR ITS DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, PARTNERS, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, OR AFFILIATES, BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (I) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE; (II) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON OR ACCESSED THROUGH THE SERVICE; (III) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICE (INCLUDING THIRD-PARTY STREAMS); AND (IV) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>

        <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to our Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>
        <p>Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>

        <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of [Your Country/State - Placeholder, e.g., "the State of California, United States"], without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
        <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding the Service.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days' notice (e.g., by posting on this page or through an in-app notification, if feasible) prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
        <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use the Service.</p>
